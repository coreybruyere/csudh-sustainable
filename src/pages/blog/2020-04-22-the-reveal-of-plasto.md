Our final event was created to reveal the amount of plastic water bottles collected from campus throughout the academic year, including our campus clean up event and our weekly water bottle trade in events. The Art Department will have previously taken the collected plastic water bottles and use them to create a “Waste Monster” named Plasto in efforts to uniquely showcase the amount of plastic we collected from our previous events. (Can also recruit student volunteers to help build the monster). The reveal of Plasto will be presented on the lawn in front of LSU. We will have music provided by KDHR, and a variety of vegan, zero-waste snacks. Bring your new CSUDH Sustainability reusable stainless steel cup for drinks!)
