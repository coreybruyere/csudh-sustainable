In this Clubs & Orgs Campus Clean up Competition, participants will be given gloves and trash bins to clean up any and all trash on our campus. The clubs that collect the most trash (in weight) will win a cash prize for their club (3 winners). The event will begin with check-in and registration at 10am in LSU. Upon registration, individual participants receive a reusable water bottle with our CSUDH Sustainability Logo on it for their efforts. Our infographics on plastic pollution and waste monster displayed at check-in table as well as free fridge magnets that includes info on upcoming “Heal The Bay” website link, clean up events in the area, and our CSUDH Sustainability logo and website as well. There will be a variety of vegan, zero-waste snacks that will be provided. (Bring your new stainless steel Sustainability cup for drinks!) Large scales brought to front lawn at the end of clean up to weigh all trash that clubs gathered and determine the winners. (Winning prizes go to the club/org, not to an individual.) After winners have been announced, the event will conclude with the announcement for our 3rd and final event: the big reveal of all the trash that our campus has collected in an academic year.
