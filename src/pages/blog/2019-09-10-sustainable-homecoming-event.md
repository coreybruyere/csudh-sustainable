We will partner with ASI and the art department collect single-use plastic bottles in efforts to reduce the plastic on campus. Since this is an ongoing event that will take place every Tuesday from 9am-2pm, we will kick off our event by hosting a booth at our homecoming in which students can trade in 2 single-use plastic bottles and receive a stainless steel water bottle. At our Homecoming booth, we will have the “planet earth” costume that Sustainability had at Earth Day for people to wear for pictures. People who take pictures with the Earth will be directed to post and tag CSUDH Sustainability, using the hashtag #ToroGreen for a chance to win a metal straw customized with our CSUDH Sustainability Logo (25 Winners chosen per week). We will be utilizing the already existing CSUDH Sustainability booth, every Tuesday (from 9am-2pm) at the Farmers Market on campus students will be able to have the opportunity to trade in plastic bottles for stainless steel. There will be infographics on food waste, plastic waste, and sustainability available at our table and we will have info on our next 2 events so that students can mark their calendars and RSVP online.
